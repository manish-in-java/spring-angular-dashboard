This is an Angular application, bundled as a Spring Boot WAR file.
It can be run as a regular Spring Boot using the following command:

```
mvn spring-boot:run
```

Alternatively, it can also be run as an Angular application using the
following command on Unix-like systems:

```
./ng serve
```

**Credit**: The entire Angular code has been taken from
https://github.com/bloodymind/angular-material-dashboard - I have not
developed any of it on my own. The only changes I have made are to get
it working with Angular 10.
